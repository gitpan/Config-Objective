Config::Objective
=================

The Config::Objective module provides a mechanism for parsing config files
to manipulate configuration data.  Unlike most other config file modules,
which represent config data as simple variables, Config::Objective
represents config data as perl objects.  This allows for a much more
flexible configuration language, since new classes can be easily written
to add methods to the config syntax.

For more information, see the enclosed Config::Objective documentation.
