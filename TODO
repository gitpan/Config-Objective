- replace include_dir with include_path (multiple directories) ???

- have $conf->objname return object reference instead of calling get() method?

- split up test.conf into multiple, smaller config files
  (add tests for expected failures, too)

- add some sort of global token replacement facility?
  (i.e., want to be able to do ``%include "platform/%{platform}.conf"'')

- Config::Objective::Hash problems:
  - replace 'value_optional' and 'value_type' options with a reference
    to a subroutine to perform input validation?

- architecture:
  - make data types work recursively?
  - allow method arguments to be the result of another method call? Example:
      motd->gsub("%h", hostname->get());
  - allow usage of methods to access nested data.  Example:
      hash->find('key')->list_delete('foo');
